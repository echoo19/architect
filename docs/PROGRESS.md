# Progress

Dated log, newest first. Each entry: what was done, what's next, open issues, risks. The next session starts here.

## 2026-10-27 (Mon), Phase 0 into Phase 1

**Done**
- Docs: spec, agent rules (`CLAUDE.md`), plan, architecture, decisions 001 to 018, harness format, verified model facts (`MODELS.md`), gotchas. Two second opinions from GPT-6 Astra shaped the sample job (decision 005) and the evaluation protocol (decisions 006, 007, 009).
- Merged on main, 946 tests passing, CI green:
  - `packages/shared`: contracts and IPC schemas.
  - `packages/harness`: harness and graduate folders (validation, hashing, diffs, versions, `report.json` and `report.md`, lineage).
  - `packages/adapters`: Meta, Baseten and Modal mentors; Ollama and OpenAI-compatible students. Live-checked: Meta mentor with streaming, JSON-schema output and reasoning on both tiers; local Glimmer through Ollama.
  - `packages/ui` and `apps/desktop`: design tokens, component library, the app shell, settings, command palette; hidden Playwright screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`.
  - `examples/home-services`: Ferncliff Home Services, 180 audited tasks, `businessDate` 2026-11-05, every answer id tied to its own record (decision 018).
  - `packages/engine`: runtime (data, tools, QuickJS sandbox, agent loop, checkers, splitter, vault) and core loop (mentor gate, keep or revert, budgets, seeds, noise pilot, storage, report card, engine host), connected to the real packages by `createEngineDeps`. Runtime failures (server down, model missing, key rejected) stop an evaluation instead of counting as wrong answers.
- Developer scripts: `packages/engine/scripts/calibrate.ts` (bare pass rate, `--traces`) and `scripts/run.ts` (one headless run end to end, with a smoke profile).

**Feasibility checks**
- Meta Model API: key works. `GET /v1/models` lists `muse-spark-1.3` and `muse-spark-1.3-contributor` among others. A Chat Completions call to `muse-spark-1.3` with one tool and `reasoning_effort: "low"` returned a correct tool call (542 prompt tokens, 243 completion tokens, 173 of them reasoning).
- Muse Glimmer locally: works, slowly. `muse-glimmer:30b` (dense 30B, 18 GB at 4-bit) on an RTX 4070 Ti (12 GB) with 31 GB RAM: Ollama splits it 48% CPU / 52% GPU, 11.5 GB VRAM in use, about 9 GB of RAM. First load 27.6 s. Prefill about 520 tokens/s warm. Generation 5.5 to 5.7 tokens/s. One agent step took 143 tokens, about 26 s. GPU stayed at 45 C. `think: false` produced the same tokens with the reasoning hidden, so it saves nothing.
- Fallback applied (spec risk table): train on a hosted copy of Glimmer during development, and run the locked tests and the demo on the local model.
- Bare-student pass rate: calibration running on local Glimmer (15 tasks, about 2.3 minutes each). The first two invoice tasks ended without writing a row; the default 8-step limit is the likely cause, because a bare invoice needs about 8 table reads before it can compute.

**In progress (parallel branches)**
- Creation-flow screens (Describe, Clarify, Define, Train, Report).
- Workspace and first-run screens.
- Workspace agent host with the loopback-only guard and the offline test.
- Desktop integration: engine in a utility process, encrypted secrets, IPC domains, sandbox bundling, the sample job as a shipped resource, packaging.

**Next**
- Read the calibration traces; settle the default step limit and check the sample job's difficulty (target 35 to 60% bare).
- First real run end to end (`scripts/run.ts`, smoke profile, contributor-tier mentor).
- Merge the screens, the agent host and the desktop integration: the full vertical slice in the app.

**Open issues**
- No hosted Glimmer key yet (OpenRouter, Together or DeepInfra). Without one, every training run uses the local student at about 2.3 minutes per attempt, which limits rounds and seeds.
- Self-hosted Spark Open needs Baseten or Modal credits, and the Baseten id must be confirmed with `GET /v1/models` once a key exists.

**Mentor spend:** about $0.01 of the $150 credit.
