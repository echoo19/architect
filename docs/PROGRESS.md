# Progress

Dated log, newest first. Each entry: what was done, what's next, open issues, risks. The next session starts here.

## 2026-10-27 (Mon), Phase 0 into Phase 1

**Done**
- Docs: spec, agent rules (`CLAUDE.md`), plan, architecture, decisions 001 to 018, harness format, verified model facts (`MODELS.md`), gotchas. Two second opinions from GPT-6 Astra shaped the sample job (decision 005) and the evaluation protocol (decisions 006, 007, 009).
- Merged on main, 946 tests passing, CI green:
  - `packages/shared`: contracts and IPC schemas.
  - `packages/harness`: harness and graduate folders (validation, hashing, diffs, versions, `report.json` and `report.md`, lineage).
  - `packages/adapters`: Meta, Baseten and Modal mentors; Ollama and OpenAI-compatible students. Live-checked: Meta mentor with streaming, JSON-schema output and reasoning on both tiers; local Glimmer through Ollama.
  - `packages/ui` and `apps/desktop`: design tokens, component library, the app shell, settings, command palette; hidden Playwright screenshots in `docs/screenshots/`.
  - `examples/home-services`: Ferncliff Home Services, 180 audited tasks, `businessDate` 2026-11-05, every answer id tied to its own record (decision 018).
  - `packages/engine`: runtime (data, tools, QuickJS sandbox, agent loop, checkers, splitter, vault) and core loop (mentor gate, keep or revert, budgets, seeds, noise pilot, storage, report card, engine host), connected to the real packages by `createEngineDeps`. Runtime failures (server down, model missing, key rejected) stop an evaluation instead of counting as wrong answers.
- Developer scripts: `packages/engine/scripts/calibrate.ts` (bare pass rate, `--traces`) and `scripts/run.ts` (one headless run end to end, with a smoke profile).

**Feasibility checks**
- Meta Model API: key works. `GET /v1/models` lists `muse-spark-1.3` and `muse-spark-1.3-contributor` among others. A Chat Completions call to `muse-spark-1.3` with one tool and `reasoning_effort: "low"` returned a correct tool call (542 prompt tokens, 243 completion tokens, 173 of them reasoning).
- Muse Glimmer locally: works, slowly. `muse-glimmer:30b` (dense 30B, 18 GB at 4-bit) on an RTX 4070 Ti (12 GB) with 31 GB RAM: Ollama splits it 48% CPU / 52% GPU, 11.5 GB VRAM in use, about 9 GB of RAM. First load 27.6 s. Prefill about 520 tokens/s warm. Generation 5.5 to 5.7 tokens/s. One agent step took 143 tokens, about 26 s. GPU stayed at 45 C. `think: false` produced the same tokens with the reasoning hidden, so it saves nothing.
- Fallback applied (spec risk table): train on a hosted copy of Glimmer during development, and run the locked tests and the demo on the local model.
- Bare-student pass rate, measured:
  - Local Glimmer, 15 calibration tasks, 8-turn limit: 5/15 (overdue 5/5, invoices 0/5, scheduling 0/5). Traces showed every write task hitting the turn limit while still reading tables; decision 020 raised the default to 16.
  - Hosted Glimmer (OpenRouter, key added by the owner), 45 dev tasks: 30/45 at first. Scheduling failures were replies cut off by the 2,048-token output cap during reasoning, which the loop took as an empty final answer. Fixed: a cut-off reply now ends the attempt with a clear error, and the cap is 4,096. Re-measured: 34/45 = 76% (invoices 9/15, overdue 13/15, scheduling 12/15). Hosted attempts take about 18 s (p50) and cost about $0.018 each.
  - 76% bare against an 85% target leaves too little room, and a one-shot mentor would likely match Architect. After a second opinion from GPT-6 Astra: one bounded revision of the sample job (cross-customer overdue questions solvable within the turn budget, customer time windows for scheduling, paired boundary cases), then freeze; the current job stays as a secondary benchmark. In progress on its own branch.
- First real run (local Glimmer, contributor-tier mentor, smoke profile): bare dev 4/6. Round 1: the mentor diagnosed "One-call invoice pricer to fit step budget" ($0.0019) and wrote a tool; on dev the student then passed invoices it had failed, in 85 s instead of 311 s. Run still finishing (local attempts take 5 to 11 minutes).

**Merged since:** creation-flow screens, workspace and first-run screens, the workspace agent host (loopback-only guard, offline test), the desktop integration (supervised utility processes, encrypted keys, all IPC domains, packaging). 35 hidden e2e specs pass against the real engine. An independent review (Fable) found one real security issue, fixed: a job file could send a stored key to any host; keys are now bound to their service's hosts.

**In progress (parallel branches)**
- Fixes for the review's other findings (rejected rounds visible to the mentor, split refusals end the run, locked-test reasons without expected values, wider leak fingerprint, firmer caps, secrets file safety, `devRepeats` against dev noise).
- The sample job's bounded revision.

**Next**
- Read the calibration traces; settle the default step limit and check the sample job's difficulty (target 35 to 60% bare).
- First real run end to end (`scripts/run.ts`, smoke profile, contributor-tier mentor).
- Merge the screens, the agent host and the desktop integration: the full vertical slice in the app.

**Open issues**
- Two commits reached main red today (a filtered local check hid failures); `pnpm check` now gates commits on its exit code.
- `docs/screenshots/` holds e2e screenshots with fixture data; the README must use screenshots of real runs.
- OpenRouter spend is the owner's money: about $1.90 so far for calibration; main runs estimated in the tens of dollars, to be kept as small as the protocol allows.
- Self-hosted Spark Open needs Baseten or Modal credits, and the Baseten id must be confirmed with `GET /v1/models` once a key exists.

**Mentor spend:** about $0.01 of the $150 credit.
